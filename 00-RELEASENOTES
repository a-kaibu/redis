8.2-RC1 (v8.1.240)    Committed Thu 3 Jul 2025 20:00:00 IST
===========================================================

This is the first Release Candidate of Redis Open Source 8.0.

Release Candidates are feature-complete pre-releases. Pre-releases are not suitable for production use.

### Headlines

Redis 8.2 introduces major performance and memory footprint improvements, new commands, and command extensions.

8.2-RC1 is available as a Docker image and can be downloaded from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis). Additional distributions will be introduced in upcoming pre-releases.

### Security fixes

- (CVE-2025-27151) redis-check-aof may lead to stack overflow and potential RCE

### New Features

- #14130 Streams - new commands: `XDELEX` and `XACKDEL`; extension to `XADD` and `XTRIM`
- #14039 New command: `CLUSTER SLOT-STATS` - get per-slot usage metrics such as key count, CPU time, and network I/O
- #14122 `VSIM` - new `IN` operator for filtering expression
- #Q6329, #Q6329 - Query Engine - new SVS-VAMANA vector index type which supports vector compression (optimized for Intel machines)

### Bug fixes

- #14143 Gracefully handle short read errors for hashes with TTL during full sync

### Performance and resource utilization improvements

- #14103 Optimize `BITCOUNT` by introducing prefetching
- #14121 Optimize `SCAN` by performing expiration checks only on DBs with volatile keys
- #14140 Optimize expiry check in `scanCallback`
- #14131 Optimize `LREM`, `LPOS`, `LINSERT`, `ZRANK`, and more by caching `string2ll` results in `quicklistCompare`
- #14088 Optimize `COPY`, `RENAME`, and `RESTORE` when TTL is used
- #14074 Reduce the overhead associated with tracking `malloc`’s usable memory
- #13900 Optimize the client’s cron to avoid blocking the main thread
- #J1351 JSON - memory footprint improvement by inlining numbers (MOD-9511)

### Metrics

- #14067 `INFO`: `used_memory_peak_time` - time when `used_memory_peak` was hit
- #13990 `INFO`:
  - `master_current_sync_attempts` - number of times the replica attempted to sync to a master since last disconnection
  - `master_total_sync_attempts` - number of times the replica attempted to sync to a master
  - `master_link_up_since_seconds` - number of seconds since the link has been up
  - `total_disconnect_time_sec` - total cumulative time we've been disconnected as a replica
